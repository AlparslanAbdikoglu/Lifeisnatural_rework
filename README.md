E-Commerce Storefront with Medusa.js, React, and Docker üöÄ
Welcome to the E-Commerce Storefront project! This repository is a work-in-progress (WIP) to create a fully functional, scalable e-commerce platform using Medusa.js as the backend, React as the frontend, and Docker for containerization. 

The project is designed to be deployed with a reverse proxy powered by Traefik and utilizes Supabase PostgreSQL as the database.



Project Overview ‚ú®
This project aims to integrate cutting-edge technologies to build a modern e-commerce storefront. The architecture consists of two main parts:

Frontend (React): A sleek storefront for customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
Backend (Medusa API): A robust and customizable e-commerce backend that powers product management, customer orders, and more.
The entire app is containerized with Docker, and traffic is routed and managed with Traefik for SSL, load balancing, and reverse proxying.

Features üöÄ
React Frontend: A responsive and dynamic storefront for showcasing products.
Medusa.js Backend: A headless e-commerce platform for managing the backend operations of the store.
Docker & Docker Compose: For containerizing both the frontend and backend, ensuring portability and scalability.
Traefik Reverse Proxy: To handle routing, SSL certificates (via Let's Encrypt), and automatic service discovery in the Docker containers.
Supabase PostgreSQL: A scalable and managed PostgreSQL database for Medusa.
Current Status üöß (WIP)
The project is in an active development stage and the following features have been set up:

Docker containerization for both React and Medusa API.
Docker Compose configuration to run everything together (Frontend, Backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Traefik).
Basic Traefik configuration to handle routing and SSL certificates.
PostgreSQL integration with Medusa.js for database management.
However, there are still some areas to be completed, including:

Finalizing the database setup with Supabase.
Optimizing the deployment for production.
Additional configuration for scaling and improving app performance with docker.

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Medusa.js
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
